Person 1: I don’t know why I even bother anymore. Everything just feels pointless.

Person 2: I know the feeling. It's like every time I try, I just get knocked down again. What’s the point of trying so hard when nothing ever changes?

Person 1: Exactly. I’m tired of pretending things are fine when they’re clearly not. Everyone around me keeps telling me to stay positive, but it’s exhausting.

Person 2: People say "stay positive" like it's that easy. They have no idea what it feels like to be trapped in your own mind, where everything just feels... wrong.

Person 1: It’s like screaming, but no one can hear you. And even if they do, they just tell you to calm down, or that it’ll get better. I’m so sick of hearing that.

Person 2: Yeah, "it'll get better." They say that as if that magically fixes things. They don’t get how hard it is to even get out of bed some days.

Person 1: Right? And when I try to talk about it, I just get shut down. Like, how are you supposed to ask for help when no one really listens?

Person 2: That’s the worst part. You reach out, and they either don’t take you seriously or make it about themselves. It’s like, just once, I wish someone would actually understand.

Person 1: I feel so angry all the time, but then I hate myself for feeling that way. I hate everything and everyone, but mostly I hate how I can’t control any of it.

Person 2: I get that. I keep snapping at people, even the ones who care about me. Then I end up feeling guilty, like I'm the problem.

Person 1: And the guilt just piles on top of everything else. It’s like carrying this weight that never goes away, no matter what you do.

Person 2: I’ve tried everything—distractions, talking to people, even therapy—but nothing makes the pain go away. It just lingers, like it’s always there, waiting to pull me back down.

Person 1: Same here. I don’t even know who I am anymore. It feels like I’ve lost myself in all this darkness, and no one can pull me out.

Person 2: It’s like you’re drowning, and every time you think you’re reaching the surface, something pulls you deeper.

Person 1: Yeah... and the more I try to explain it, the more people think I’m just being dramatic. I’m not! I’m just... tired. So tired of everything.

Person 2: I wish I could make them understand. But maybe it doesn’t matter. Maybe we’re just stuck feeling like this forever.

Person 1: I really hope that’s not true, but... I don’t know anymore. It’s hard to see any light at the end of this.

Person 2: Yeah. I don’t know if there’s a way out. Some days, it feels like I’m just waiting for the next bad thing to happen.

Person 1: I just want some peace, for once. I want my mind to stop attacking me.

Person 2: Me too. I don’t want to feel this angry, or this sad, or this... lost. But here we are.
