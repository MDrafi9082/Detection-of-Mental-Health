Alex: Hey… you awake?

Jordan: Yeah, can't sleep again. What's up?

Alex: Just feeling... off, you know? Everything feels so heavy lately.

Jordan: I get it. It’s been the same for me. Every day feels like it's dragging me down, like I’m stuck in quicksand.

Alex: Exactly. It’s like I’m surrounded by people, but I feel so alone. I don’t even know who I am anymore.

Jordan: That hits hard. Sometimes I wonder what the point of all this is. Like, why keep trying when it feels like nothing ever changes?

Alex: Yeah, I keep telling myself it'll get better, but it never does. I’m so tired of pretending everything’s fine when it’s not.

Jordan: Same. I put on a happy face for everyone, but inside I feel like I’m falling apart.

Alex: I don’t even recognize myself anymore. It’s like the person I used to be is gone, and all that’s left is... this empty shell.

Jordan: I know what you mean. I keep trying to fill this void with work, distractions, whatever... but nothing helps. It’s just... there.

Alex: I’ve tried talking to people about it, but they don’t understand. They just say, "Stay positive, things will get better." But what if they don’t?

Jordan: Yeah, those words don't really help. It’s like people think you can just snap out of it, but they don’t see how deep it goes.

Alex: Sometimes I wonder if it’s worth it, you know? Trying so hard just to keep going. I don’t even know why I’m doing it anymore.

Jordan: I think about that too. It’s like there’s this darkness I can’t escape from, no matter how much I try.

Alex: And the worst part is, I don’t want to burden anyone with how I feel. But keeping it all in is eating me alive.

Jordan: You’re not a burden, Alex. I feel the same way. It’s like we’re both drowning, and no one notices.

Alex: Yeah... maybe we’re just really good at hiding it.

Jordan: I wish I knew how to make it stop. The constant noise in my head... it never shuts up. It’s exhausting.

Alex: Me too. It’s like my mind is always racing, reminding me of every failure, every mistake. And I can’t turn it off.

Jordan: I get that. It’s like we’re fighting this invisible battle, and no one sees the scars it leaves behind.

Alex: I just hope one day, something changes. Because I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this.

Jordan: You’re not alone in this, okay? I’m here, even if we’re both struggling. We’ll figure it out, somehow.

Alex: Thanks, Jordan. It helps knowing someone understands. Even if we don’t have all the answers.
